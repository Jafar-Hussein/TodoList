# Todo Application
## Link to Repository
[Jafars repo](https://github.com/Campus-Molndal-JIN23/todolist-Jafar-Hussein)
## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create a simple and user-friendly todo application. By building this application, I wanted to explore and understand the process of developing an application from scratch.

The project is a todo application that helps users organize and manage their tasks. Users can create, edit, delete and mark tasks as completed. The application provides a clear overview of the remaining and completed tasks.

By building this project, I have learned concepts and techniques in Java programming. I have gained experience in developing backend functionality and working with Java frameworks to create a robust and efficient application.
